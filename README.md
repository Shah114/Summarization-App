# Summarization-App
This project is a web-based text summarization application built using the Flask framework and the pipeline module from Hugging Face's transformers library. The app allows users to input large blocks of text, and it generates concise summaries using a state-of-the-art pre-trained model.

The web interface is designed with HTML, CSS (styled with a light blue and white color scheme), and includes basic animations to enhance user experience. <br/>
